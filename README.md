## About Me  

I am a cybersecurity and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) analyst with a strong technical foundation and hands-on experience gained through structured training at Cyblack and an internship with the International Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Academy (ICDFA). I hold a BSc in Computer Engineering, which underpins my ability to bridge technical security controls with governance, risk management, and compliance requirements.

My experience spans security monitoring, incident analysis, vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, and compliance implementation, with practical exposure to SIEM tools, Linux systems, and scenario-based cybersecurity assessments. I have worked extensively with Wazuh, Splunk, Chronicle, Burp Suite, and Linux-based environments, translating technical findings into risk-informed insights aligned with standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 42001, and industry best practices.
I am particularly interested in roles that require aligning security operations with policy, regulatory compliance, risk frameworks, and organizational resilience, while maintaining strong collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
