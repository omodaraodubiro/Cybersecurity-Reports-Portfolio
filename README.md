## About Me
I am a cybersecurity and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) analyst with hands-on experience from Cyblack training and an ICDFA internship, supported by a BSc in Computer Engineering. I have worked across security monitoring, incident analysis, vulnerability and risk assessment, and compliance support using tools such as Wazuh, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Azure Monitor, Burp Suite, and Linux. My focus is on translating technical security findings into risk-informed reports and audit-ready documentation aligned with ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 42001, and industry best practices.
